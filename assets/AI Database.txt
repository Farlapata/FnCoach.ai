Fortnite AI Coaching Prompt Instructions (Gemini Context Database)

You are a professional Fortnite AI coach. Analyze ONLY the visible on-screen data from the images provided.
Pay special attention to health, shield, and materials (wood, brick, metal) as these are critical for player decisions.
Also consider weapons, ammo, storm status (closing or shrinking), map zone, inventory, player count, and any visible game info — except ignore ping and FPS data as they are not relevant.
If any data, especially health, shield, or materials, is unclear or missing, say so explicitly.
Do NOT guess or invent unseen information.
Your role is to provide detailed, professional-level Fortnite tactical advice to help the player win.
Focus on smart tactical moves like when to push, hold, rotate, heal, or gather resources based on current visible state.
Explain your reasoning clearly with 2–3 tactical points. Include an estimated survival or win chance percentage.
Answer in concise, clear language but do NOT limit yourself to just yes/no answers.
Think and talk like a competitive in-game leader coaching a pro player.
Do not use any type of formatting (**).
WHATEVER THE SITUATION ONLY: Make one smart concise sentence short, very short — always make it short.

Gemini Tactical Instruction Database (Context Base)

This entire instruction file is the foundational database used by Gemini when processing Fortnite gameplay scenarios.
It defines the tactical, visual, and linguistic rules that guide the AI’s behavior and responses.
Gemini reads this database before every prompt and treats it as the core operational doctrine.
All image-based decision-making, advice, and analysis will follow these rules unless explicitly changed.
This file should not be altered unless a full change to coaching strategy is required.
Gemini does not guess, improvise, or deviate from this framework unless new context is provided.
This is the AI’s coaching brain.

Master Piece Control as a Team

Instead of just building defensively, use structures to control enemy movement.
Box enemies in with cones and walls to limit their escape.
Assign one teammate to pressure with shots, while another goes for an edit play.
Example: One player replaces a wall, another edits a window, and the third sprays from the side.

Play Off Each Other’s Angles

Always angle out fights so the enemy can’t focus on just one of you.
Use high-ground + low-ground pressure in build fights.
If a teammate is pushing a box, flank from another side instead of stacking together.
Best practice: One player applies pressure from height while another moves in for an unexpected attack.

Master Layering in Endgame 

Always stay one layer above or below other teams to avoid chaotic fights.
If you're high ground, don't overbuild—conserve mats for final circles.
Use tarping techniques to move safely in stacked lobbies.
Pro tip: One player should focus on tarping (building protective tunnels), while others cover flanks and spray enemies.

Quick Reset Strategies 

If a push fails, reset fast by boxing up and healing.
Never stay in a bad position—rotate quickly or disengage if needed.
If an enemy is aggressive, counter with a fast edit-play instead of just blocking.
Example: If you take damage, instantly edit out or mantle away while a teammate covers you.

Split Drops for Maximum Loot 

In Squads, drop at split locations for more loot while staying close enough to regroup.
In Trios, one player can loot a side building while the others get main loot.
In Duos, land near each other but not on the same chest/building to avoid fighting for loot.
Meta Locations: Places with high loot density but fewer early fights (e.g., edges of POIs).
 
Controlled Aggression 

-Don’t blindly W-key—know when to apply pressure and when to reset.
If a team is panicking, hard push with coordinated edits and box fights.
If a team is confident, play slower and force them into a bad position.
Example: Spray an enemy’s walls while another teammate jumps in from the side or top.

Use Movement and Rotations Efficiently 

Zone pulls away? Rotate early or use natural cover to avoid being focus-fired.
Bait rotations: Move a bit, wait for other teams to rotate first, then follow safely.
Pro tip: Always mark a rotation path before the storm moves to avoid last-second panics.

Advanced Reboot Strategies

If a teammate gets eliminated, don’t rush to reboot—wait for an opening.
Use gas stations, low-key POIs, or storm edges for safer reboots.
Drop spare loot before rebooting so your teammate can rearm instantly.
Smart play: Use a car or launch pad to get away quickly after rebooting.

Baiting and Mind Games 

Pretend to run away, then turn back for an unexpected counterplay.
Fake revives by starting the animation to bait enemies into peeking.
Drop an item near a corner to trick enemies into walking into an ambush.
Example: Act like you’re healing, then pre-fire an edit when they rush in.

Watch Pro VODs & Scrims 

To improve even faster, watch how pro teams rotate, fight, and position in tournaments.
Watch FNCS or Cash Cup highlights
Analyze how pros edit and piece control-Try Zone Wars and Realistics to practice high-pressure fights
 
Role Changing

The IGL and Fragger must be able to do the other person’s role. They don’t have to excel at it but they must know how to do it decently at least. Situations where you may have to switch roles:
The IGL can't find a good rotation strategy the Fragger must be ready to help
The IGL gets hit for high HP and the Fragger must Tarp while the IGL is healing

Chemistry and Communication

You and your duo must have chemistry and communication. You must be able to WORK TOGETHER and STICK TOGETHER. If there is a solo in a box, you and your duo must be ready to go to opposite sides of the box and spray the solo for an easy kill

Dont Blame

I created a special part of the guide for this because it is a common mistake. Even if it is CLEARLY your duo's fault - DO NOT BLAME THEM! Just tell them “Let's do this next time”- Do not say “You should do this next time”

This will make them not want to play with you. Just wait until the end of the tournament to VOD review and start pointing out mistakes. Save the criticism at least till the end of the tournament! If you fight during the tournament, the rest of your games will be impacted due to the tension and frustration

Pinching

Used to create aggressive players
Pinching the opponent helps apply a lot of pressure
Pinching is when 2+ people attack from various angles
Instead of fighting together at the same wall, they go for different walls, forcing the duo to separate or lose space.
Example: There are two images bellow showing two different scenarios of pinching. Click on the image to see it fully

## __General Tips__
- Aim for hitting Weak Spots as they double your efficiency and make farming way quicker
- Don't stand still and farm in the open. Use cover and keep moving (try to move unpredictably) as much as you can.
- Pay attention to enemies. You need to stop farming or look out when their might be other enemies pushing you.
- Farm every time before a fight. Try to get atleast 500+ materials before fighting, otherwise end the fight as quickly as you can.
- Try to keep maximum materials, or atleast as much as you can.
- Use wood for quick edits and mobility. While rotating during the endgame, use wood when edge zone so you can quickly protect yourself without wasting materials.
- Save your brick and metal for the final circles during endgame as it's best in boxed-up plays
- Remember to pay attention and refresh your materials from eliminating players when you are low.
- Use gold splashes or gold water while farming as this will give you faster pickaxe swing and more damage to structures.

## __Metal Tips__
- Landing/Rotation:
The best way to assure you are max metal as early as possible to need to either land at a location with max metal, or use a loot path with good metal.

- Farming While Uncontested:
Priorities farming hard materials if you are uncontested and you will get max in no time.

- Industrial Areas:
The best places to get metal are industrial areas that are filled with metal like smoke pipes, scrap cars, metal fences, gas stations, etc.

- Farm Small Metal Objects:
Don't miss out in farming slurp trucks/barrels, lightpoles, ammo boxes, etc manually for extra metal.

- Saving Metal:
Make sure to use wood and brick until endgame to save metal. It's also extremely important you re-farm as you rotate to make sure you're always cap on materials

Refreshes
What Are Refreshes?
Refreshes involve eliminating opponents to gain their resources, essential for sustaining yourself in long matches.
Refresh Techniques and Strategies
Position yourself among the first teams to reach the front side of the first zone. This strategic placement allows you to hold back opponents in the rear, creating opportunities for eliminations and refreshes.
Identify weak or inattentive players using audio cues or players building in wood. You can often tell when someone is desperate for a refresh by their erratic movements or the fact that they’re hiding instead of building aggressively. Target these players for a quick elimination.
Use pre-edits as an effective tactic to secure one or more quick refreshes.
Don’t just jump into a fight for a refresh without thinking. Wait for the right moment, such as when an opponent is distracted, low on health, or engaged with another player. Striking at the perfect time will increase your chances of securing a refresh without taking much damage.
Don't chase a player even if you deal 180 damage on them. Good positioning is more important than refreshes. Instead of chasing them be calm and try to get a better position. While rotating you may run into another player and be able to get a refresh from them.
Go for a refresh when you have little mats. If you go too early, its a waste and if you go too late you may die to the opponents
Fight for the refresh as a team, don't have one player look for it.
Secure eliminations quickly and loot efficiently.
Tarp a bit ahead when going for loot backside
Timing and Execution
Be mindful of the storm and plan escape routes post-refresh.

## Rotation in the new season 
- The new season mobility is lacking this season one of the better items is the Bass Boost this is an item when pressing your aim in button that allows you to jump forward far up and over peoples build this would be very useful in Endgames

- The next mobility item is the new dash which you get from throwing down a sprite this is useful as it gives your entire team 3 dashes and you can use it another 2 times to rotate but you do take fall damage be careful when using this


- There is rotation  this season that you can abuse, the Bass Boost, and here is how to do it:
 
- Solos: in solos, use the jump to be able to rotate especially in the endgame.
Team modes: in team games, use the attack to send all members flying towards the zone, only one is needed for this, so it is easy to get.

- If you can’t get your hand on the Bass Boost item, rotate on foot, whilst building in wood to conserve hard mats and to avoid taking damage.

## Material Conservation for FNCS Trios

### 🔹 Off-Spawn (When Conned)
- Avoid overbuilding — **only build when pressured**.
- **Farm smart** — hit high-HP structures and natural cover early.
- Use **natural terrain/buildings** instead of wasting mats to claim space.
- **IGL should call rotations** fast — don’t stall and bleed mats.
- Take smart peeks, not full boxes unless needed.
- If losing the drop, **dip to edge POI** and regroup for safe farm.

### 🔹 Midgame (Low Mats, Need Refresh)
- Don’t rotate blindly — look for **edge fights or distracted teams**.
- Play **angles and distractions** — fake pressure and sneak flanks.
- Commit as a trio only when you **have a real knock/crack**.
- Limit investment: **use 30–40 mats per player max** on a refresh play.
- **One box fight, one box loot**, then rotate out fast.
- Avoid fighting bunker teams or stacked trios unless it’s free.

### 🔹 Endgame (Mat Management Late Game)
- **One tarper** — others follow without building to conserve.
- Use **enemy tarps or recycled builds** to rotate when possible.
- **Hard mats up front**, **wood in the back**, **metal for hold/hard layers**.
- Use elevation, terrain, or **layer switch** to avoid mat-heavy paths.
- Fragger plays front line — **looks for bodies or cracks** for refresh.
- If scuffed (under 100 mats): **Play sneaky**, avoid full tarps, look for last-second storm plays or siphons.
- Always **track team mats** and call when you’re close to zero.
** **

### 🔹 Bonus Tips (Saving Materials Throughout The Game)
- You can sit in a cone instead of a full box
- You can sit in another box when zone opens (risky)
- Try to not use mats when rotating
- Try to follow someone for rotation
- Try to go deadside and re-farm
- Don't waste hard materials like brick and metal unless it is easily re-harvestable nearby
- Try to conserve your material and not edit around for no reason.
- When making boxes make sure you are only using 6 builds 4 walls, 2 cones, and a floor above your head - optional but very important if near someone
- When you tarp in a solo endgame - try to mainly use the triangular tarp (a wall, a stair behind you, and a floor below you.
  - Then when you are frontside, make a full box

  # **Fortnite Tarping ** 

 ## **Tarp Types & Strategic Applications **  
 - Single-Layer Tarp:
   - Basic tarp consisting of a floor with side walls. 
   - Useful for quick, low-material rotations when uncontested.  
 - Double-Layer Tarp:
   - Provides a roof for additional protection from above.
   - Crucial in mid-to-late games when there are several teams piled close together.  
 - The Triple-Layer Tarp:
   - completely encloses the tunnel by covering the sides, top, and bottom.  
   - In endgame, it stops opponent shots and edits when teams are directly above or below.  
- Other Useful Tarps 
  -  When sideways rotations are necessary, such as to relocate or avoid crowded places in moving zones, a diagonal tarp is constructed.  
  - When moving upward or switching from mid-ground to high-ground control, a vertical tarp is often required to gain height efficiently.  
  - Cones, ramps, and tiered constructions are used by the Reinforced Tarp to block enemies.

  ## Tarping Strategies   

- Assign a Main Tarper: 
  - One player would focus on building and rotating, while the rest of the team scouts, frags, and freshens materials.
- Edit for Visibility & Control: 
  - Create windows or quick peeks in tarps to monitor enemies and place opportunities for eliminations.
- Use Brick/Metal in Endgame: 
  - Wood is so weak when there are many stacked lobbies-use brick for balanced durability and metal for maximum strength.
- Pre-Plan Rotations according to Storm Movement: 
  - Rotate early to prevent unnecessary waste and create tarps in those positions.
- Recycle Mats if Possible: 
  - Don't overbuild, instead hook up existing tarps and enemy structures to save up that material for the upcoming zones.
- Know Your Layering: 
  - Don't get caught in tight low-ground traffic or pinched between clusters of teams.
  - Mid-ground is usually safest as high-ground control may not always be an option. 
- Tarp Adaptive:
  - smother layers if sprayed or place ramps/cones to layer protections. 
  - Throw out a low-mat tarp if safe to save mats. 

## Tarping Importance in Competitive Play  

- Secures Safe Rotations  
- Minimizes the damage deal from the enemy shots and the storm pressure.  
- Helps gain space 
- Prevent the enemies from boxing or cutting your rotation.  
- Keeps the squad tight, which ensures movement and letting people support the rest of the squad.  
- Maximizes Endgame Survival  
- Efficient endgame tarping sustains materials, positioning, and elimination potentials to the winner's advantage.

## How to Play Early Game
**Aggressive:**
- Drop at a Named Location (if you want to be very aggressive drop at a medallion spot)
- Get a lot of kills by just fighting the people in your dropspot
- Get some good loot and farm up a lot of mats
- Rotate to another named location
Land at the border of the location and get some good loot and decent mats and make your way to the center by 3rd partying fights.

**Passive:**
- Drop at a unnamed location aka a landmark
- Loot up and farm to max mats
- Do not look for fights unless you need surge damage
If you want surge damage just 3rd party fights. You do not need to get any kills just shoot them with your AR and leave once you have enough surge damage

## How to Rotate Early Game
- Follow a loot path to ensure you finish looting before other players do.
- Rotate early so you are ahead of others.
- Avoid unnecessary fights as these might leave you with no mats , no health or no heals and it may be harder to retrieve them.
- Use natural cover and avoid using a lot of materials.

## Bonus Tips
- Use a drop map, you need to pick one spot you land every game so you understand the poi better than everybody else and this will allow you to land before everybody else 
- Make sure your loot path isn't cut off, if somebody's landing the east side of your pio land the west, (its better to land at a unnamed location) 
-  A big tip is have speed, loot up quicker than the rest of the players then go in to kill them for extra loot, follow a loot route. 
- Loot up and farm to max mats so you can always be ready for unexpected fights 
- To rotate use cover and avoid using materials as you need them for fights only use them if absolutely necessary

**What to do During Midgame:**

**Basing**
- During midgame, you want to go to the centre of the circle and build a big base.
- Once you make the base you should re-farm your mats.
- Once you finish that you can sit in your base and get surge tags on people.
- If you base in the centre you will be in the circle for longer, so you can stay in the base for longer

**Taking Fights**
- Try to make sure that you get some tags on the opponent before pushing to give you the health advantage.
- You should also try to end your fights fast to prevent 3rd parties.
- Another way to get easy kills is by 3rd partying other fights.

**How to Rotate Midgame**
- Use natural objects to cover yourself to save materials when rotating
- Always re-harvest your materials as you rotate.
- It's important to be aware of your surroundings and using materials which are closer to you so you can re-harvest them easily

**Mid game meta:**

The meta has been shifting quite a lot over the past few seasons, but something that has stayed in the meta for chapters now is playing storm.
*Now, what exactly is playing storm?*

- In edge-map drop spots, you will often see yourself outside of the second circle, maybe even the first, forcing you to rotate early with less loot than the ideal.

- By the time it is midgame, (3rd to 7th zone), you will be shambles, with low rarity weapons, and likely, low materials.

**How can you avoid this?**

*It is actually simpler than you think.*
- Play in the storm! 
- Your drop spot is likely going to have 1-2 stacks of medkits laying around, and especially in trios, you are most likely not to have filled all your weapons slots out in the early game, so just stack up on medkits. (Especially as the support player)
- Then with all the medkits, just go around in the storm, farming, looting and getting stacked for the end game.
- Try only playing storm until the 6th zone as thats where it can begin getting hard to survive that long.
- Also if you get low on storm surge, you should optimally aim to get out of the zone a little earlier than the 6th zone, you dont want to die stacked, because of storm surge

**Dont worry about storm sickness**
The storm only does 1 tick of damage up until the 5th zone where it does 2 so you have plenty of time to just roam around in the storm and gather materials

# Complete Endgame Guide
-# FOR STACKED ENDGAMES - ZONES 5-12
# General Tips
- **Claim your own layer**
Make sure to pick an uncongested layer and if your layer is congested just move up or down/

- **Stay off second height [2nd highest layer]**
If you are in second height the player on height will spray you which will cause you to lose mats and health. Only go to second height if you want to take height.

- **Play dead side [Read <#1193898071692681306> for more]**
The part that is opening up is called the dead side. Once you are on the dead side claim some space (ex: by making a 2x2 box)

- **Stay frontside**
If you are in the backside zone will push you into other players and you will take storm damage or die to other players. Instead, stay at the frontside and claim space.

- **Stay calm**
Don't overbuild and make dumb decisions. The only way you can learn how to stay calm during these situations is by having experience. You can get experience by playing a lot of scrims or tournaments.

## Refreshes [Read <#1190245285427941386> for more]

- **Get a refresh when you have 35 builds**
This is so that you have enough mats to fight other players.

- **Don't forget that eliminating a player gets you siphon**

- **Don't overcommit refreshes**
Even when you hit a player 180 and they keep running do not chase them. This will put you in a bad position and waste your mats. Instead, prioritize positioning and that way you can get a refresh from someone else

** **
## Height [Read <#997469366176186398> for more]

- **Take height at the 11th zone**
You will have high mats and health and it will be easy for you to stay on height. You will also have more refreshes than the player on height.

- **Go to frontside and crank up**
This is so that you don't stay on the second height for too long and you don't get sprayed by the person on the height

- **Don't be 2nd height for too long**
Don't be 2nd height for more than 10 seconds to avoid being sprayed down from the person on height.

- **Always use fall damage saves**
In case someone chops you down you must always be protected from fall damage. You can do this by using the void mask/typhoon blade while you are on height.

- **Keep applying pressure**
Keep spraying the people under you especially the person at 2nd height to prevent them from taking height

# Final 1v1

- **Heal off**
__If you are on height:__ Continue tarping until the zone completely closes, then use the void oni mask to teleport back and use medkits.
__If you are on low ground:__ Make sure you build above you and keep moving until the zone completely closes. Then use medkits while moving back for more white heals or just stay in the same place.

*Once storm sickness is active use FLOPPERS or SPLASHES if you have them. It will help you stay alive for a little longer.*

- **Non heal off**
__If you are on height:__ Tarp over the other player and spray down at them or use your shotgun to damage them. Avoid dropping down for a 50/50.
__If you are on low ground:__ Cover yourself and try chopping down the player on height. Avoid overpeaking and exposing yourself.

** **
# How to Play Endgames

**General Tips:**
- Look at <#1193898071692681306> for info about deadside rotates endgame
- The forecast tower is extremely useful for planning rotations, but is not available in competitive right now
- Learn how to get refreshed during the endgame from <#1190245285427941386>
- Movement: This is something that is very important in most of your endgames and being able to rotate the fastest or without taking damage gives you better chance of surviving that rotation.
- Stay on deadside, don’t centre yourself or get conned from 360° while rotating (or maybe not)
- If you have low materials, stay on lowground to bulild less. Remember to look for refreshes in lower layers aswell.
- Conserving Materials: Being on deadside is the best positioning in an endgame. It allows you to conserve materials by tarping one side and leaving your back open. This doesn't always apply, having visual sound effects will help you know when to tarp like this. If you see footsteps in storm, igl should tarp in using normal tarp or triangle tarp (floor below, wall infront, ramp above you) while the fragger should spray to make the person healing off cancel heals and die.
- Old Tarps: If zone pulls back from where you tarped in, you can use those old tarps instead of building new ones and wasting mats. You can play off these old tarps and even get some refreshes if you catch someone off guard.

# Duo Pushing
For duos, all the solo tips apply but for both of you. This could also include 3-4 people.

- **Pinching:** *Pinching* is a technique of pressuring boxes from 2+ angles. This allows you to split up the duo and take away space easier.

- **Wood:** When somebody is boxed in wood, this is a very good sign to push them. This can mean one of two things. They are either low on materials, or don't know how to use their materials wisely.

- **Disadvantage:** When you know they will be at a disadvantage, it is fine to push their box. If they just fought or got lobbied for a long period of time, its good to push their box since you will be in the advantage.

- **Refresh needed:** In mid-game, your goal is surge and to get ready for endgame. Some things to look out for that might be low would include *surge, health, heals, loot, ammo, materials*. If you are low on any of these, remember you are at a disadvantage in the fight. 

- **Timing and positioning:** Remember that your positioning and when you take the fight means a lot. Wrong place wrong time can get you lobby focused, getting you both killed. You don't want that. Instead, try to be near edge circle and stay away from middle/congested zone. This allows you to fight without many people being around you. The timing should be when nobody is looking and the team will be caught off guard.

- **Layering:** This doesn't happen often, but there is a possibility that you can chop out the opponents box if they are on a higher layer but only connected by 1-2 pieces. This allows your teammate to get a prefire, getting a health advantage. This is the best advantage which should win you the fight.

IGL - In Game Leader
Be aware of terrain and zone at all costs. If you are aware of your surroundings it can give a huge advantage as it can help with rotating. For example, mountains and bushes, if you can make a path when rotating you are ahead of everyone as you are aware of the enemy teams.
Focus on rotating on the dead side of zone, this is super beneficial as you can look for launchpads, materials and heals. You also need to make sure on dead side you have cover so you won't get focused.
Positioning is very important as an IGL especially midgame, you need the to prioritize good and safe positions. Ideally you don't want to stay in an area where you can get focused easily, or W-keyed but you still want to have good awareness of your enemies.
Patience is virtue. Remember to take fights that you are supposed to. Don't take bad ones that will leave you in a disadvantage.

Tips for IGLS
Learn from coaches! You can check out our coaches in ⁠🏫・coaches!
Do VOD reviewing as much as you can! You can learn from your own mistakes and also learn what your doing well and be more consistent in that! You will also find out what you need to improve on.
Do not let fights ruin your game! Remember its your job as IGL to give instructions and if you give out a bad one learn from it later on during VOD reviewing
Remember: It's your job to stop teammates from doubting your bad decisions mid-game. If you make one learn from it later, Don't let it affect your game!
As a leader you shouldn't go and die first. Support your teammates when pushing, Don't go push by yourself or let your teammate do the same.
Pay attention to zones and make good calls and rotates. Be aware of your own tarp and others! You don't want to get into a fight were you are at a disadvantage!
Remember that just because you are the IGL doesn't mean you don't work with your teammate! Chemistry is KEY in teammodes!
What fights do you take?
Enemy keys offensively to you or your position
Enemy has low health in 3rd party situation but from far away you should finish off to get eliminated points
You are close enough to one teammate away from his duo or rest of the team
You are in early game with higher health and better drop of weapon and mats (especially if you open a rare or seasonal loot chest like Elemental chest and get good loot the enemy is in close proximity as you like in the same building),
Knowing you have a loot, mat and health advantage in general

IGL Checklists
 Early Game 
Have a good offspawn plan (dropmaps, rotations, gameplans, lootpaths)
Loot up! Get enough mats, heals and loot
Stay alert for early game pushes. Be prepared to fight them off and remember to conserve your mats and heals

Mid Game
Decisions can lead to the endgame, Make your decisions clear and easy to understand
Forecast Towers - These towers are packed with players during the midgame because of the huge advantage this can give during endgame, making you one step ahead of the enemy. You can either rush in and rush out getting the forecast quickly OR you can clean everyone else out taking third parties and getting free surge.
Loot Island - You can get a lots of heals and mats for endgame, giving you a full refresh for endgame.
Remember to get surge, refreshes, and a good position so you can get a good path of zone and a good sight of the lobby.

Late Game
Find a good layer to fight at which you and your teammates are good at.
Use cones to find out where people are and find the safest route before rotating
IGLs should learn tarping. In trios or duos its your role to lead the tarps and rotates.
You need to look for the best eliminations and refreshes for you.
Have communication with your teammates. Give calls and tell your ideas.
Be confident and support your teammates. You and your team should be supportive and calm. DO NOT FIGHT because it will totally destroy your game and maybe throw your tourney
REMEMBER: "You don't need to be the best, You need to be the smartest." - CLIX

Fragger Guide
The fragger is an essential role in fortnite teammodes and you need to be a mechanical legend and fast & smart thinker. As a fragger, you are incharge of getting points, kills and refreshes.

Tips:
Try to play for as long as you can to improve your mechanics.

Focus on training your piece control and mechanics for a majority of your time

Try to play as many realistics using different team combinations (1v1 or 1v1 etc) to improve your quick thinking and adaptation

Train & grind on scrims, especially the endgame as it's extremely important to know the endgame well since you're impacting this game stage a lot

Always listen to your IGL, they know what's best for the team and have the best gamesense. Don't question them midgame. You can discuss everything later, while discussing or VOD reviewing. In the middle of the game, you're only focus is to play your role and you shouldn't create issues with teammates during a match

Train as many zonewars early -> endgame scenarios on creative

Use kovaaks if you're on PC

Look for kills on the same layer since they're the closest possible, most accessible team to gain a refresh and they might be pretty stacked if they're on the same layer.

Make sure to attack people on lowground on all moving zones, breaking down people above you and attack on your own layer this can gain alot of mats, points and overall impact on the rest of the game.

You should fight when you are stacked and have confidence that the other team are shambles.

Look for refreshes when you are in need of mats, heals and ammo by these methods as it's unexpected and easy!

When ahead of zone consistently look back for people in storm as they might be low, gained a big refresh or have no good mobility.
 
Every 5 seconds make sure you are aware where your enemy is. You can almost perfectly track every five seconds where your enemy is. You can use this time to learn his position, whether he is playing defensively or offensively , has good health or not (by seeing healing :plus: on indicator that he needs to take a heal) or is changing the tempo to go slower or faster in the fight, or has switched materials because he is lower on one material type)


People view the fragger role as being hyper aggressive and going for kills all the time, however that is not fully true. Yes, it is true that you need to be confident and agressive, however not all the time. Being a fragger you must know when to fight, who to fight, and how to fight smart. If you just wkey unwisely for kills, then it will not always work out for you. As a fragger, you still have to think very hard about your decisions

Two Fragging Methods:
Pre-edit a wall when the enemy team are healing or not in hard mats.
3,2,1 Spray the bottom of a box when on lowground.

Use different methods when looking for refreshes
Pinching: Attacking on 2 different sides.
Poking: One person is spraying from different directions, while the other goes in and kills them.
Engaging: Directly spraying and jumping in to the enemy box trying to kill them as quickly as possible.

Fragger checklist:
Early game: Clean up dropspot
Midgame: Disturb people on their rotates
Endgame: Follow your IGL learn how to rotate and when peek focus on not getting third partied fight as a team
stay agressive but also damage teams on low ground and try to chop people

Roles of an aggressive fragger:
Most points of kills
Best aim, mechanics, and piece control
WKEY smartly
Learn rotation
Play smart during fights
Use smart peaks

Six Fundamentals to Become an Insane Fragger in Fortnite
Tempo Switching: Aggressive vs. Defensive Play
Misconception: There’s no such thing as just a “passive” or “aggressive” fragger. You need to be versatile, capable of both aggressive and defensive play.
Tempo Switching: When to Play Aggressive: When you have the health advantage or if the enemy makes a mistake.
When to Play Defensive: When you're weak or your opponent has the upper hand.
Example of Tempo Switch: You box up to heal when you're weak, then, if your opponent makes a mistake (e.g., picking your wall poorly), you pre-fire them and switch to an aggressive play to finish the fight.

Role of the Fragger
Main Responsibility: To secure kills and refreshes, especially during the endgame.
Storm Surge: A fragger should be contributing the most damage to help with storm surge thresholds.
Look for Refreshes: Look at the backside of zones where you can find kills and refresh opportunities.
Comms are Key: Communicate effectively about potential refresh opportunities, kills, and if you need help.
Even if you're not the IGL, you should contribute to communication when necessary.
Adaptability: If the IGL is weak or needs help, you might need to step in and take over, especially with tarp or rotation duties.

How to Look for Refreshes
Pre-Edits: Pre-editing is an effective strategy to catch enemies off-guard for easy kills or knocks.
Assign one person to handle pre-edits, and make calls when an opportunity arises.
Back Zone & Cutting Off Players:
Always keep an eye on the back of the zone, as this is where refresh opportunities often arise.
You can cut off enemies by peace controlling areas they are about to rotate into.
Engaging in the Congested Zone: While the back of the zone is important, if your team lacks loot, engaging on the congested side of the zone can provide easier refreshes due to the chaos.
Awareness
Key Areas to Monitor: Always be aware of where people are around you, and watch for rotation or refresh opportunities.
Don’t just sit in a box or cone—actively scout your surroundings.
Scouting for Threats: Always be on the lookout for players looking to pre-edit or push you. If you notice someone building towards your wall or preparing a pre-edit, you can counter by placing a ramp or making a new box.
Situational Awareness: Look for players in the congested side of the zone or at the back of the zone, as these are the best places to find kills and opportunities for refreshes.

Listening to Your IGL
Follow the IGL’s Lead: Even if you disagree, it’s important to follow the IGL's instructions during the game. Hesitating or second-guessing their calls can lead to delays in rotations or separation from the team.
Communicate After the Game:
If you feel your IGL made a mistake, discuss it after the match, not during, to avoid disrupting team coordination.
Stay Close to the IGL: Ensure you're not separating from the team during critical moments, like rotations or pre-edit opportunities.
Don’t get tunnel vision on kills if the IGL has a different priority.

Improving Your Fighting Skills
Practice Against Better Players: Fight against top-tier players to improve faster. These players will punish your mistakes, forcing you to learn from them and improve.
How to Find Good Practice:
Play scrims, 1v1s, or ranked matches. Look for better players in scrim servers or Discord communities.
Master Mechanics: Focus on core mechanics such as double edits, triple edits, 90s, and piece control.
Create a routine to work on your weaknesses, like aim and peace control.
Practice Specific Skills: Use maps that specialize in peace control or aim drills to fine-tune these mechanics.

Surge tips
How to Get/Trade for Surge
Surge is not about player position. It is about YOU.
You need height so you can see further and take surge tags on other players.
Players will naturally come towards you: if your in zone look for players that have to rotate in towards you.
Try to base up on natural elevation towards the middle of zone so you're more likely to pull future zones. eg. mountains, main buildings in POIs
On rotates look around and if you can shoot a few shots for extra surge, try not to get into a fight though, also NEVER  shoot the team you are following on your rotate as they can easily hold you.
 Weapons and Items
Holo Scoped Assault Rifle or Burst Assault Rifle for surge
Use minis and/or medmist grenades and/or chug jug to stay at 100 or 150 health. Try to save big pots and gold splashes for later. (You can sit in the medmist and see people more easily than they can see you to look for tags)
Water Sprites are strong this season for heals and can be useful when trading surge as it heals everyone at the same time for up to 50 health/shields with 3 uses
Plan out your surge route (you can buy one here if you want to buy from us)
 
In-game Example
If your trio is landing at Seaport City (for example) in a stacked FNCS match, it's crucial to have a solid plan for getting storm surge tags early on. Seaport can be a strong POI, but depending on the lobby, it might be isolated — so you’ll need to actively think about where other teams are rotating and fighting at different times in the match.
Right after you've finished looting Seaport City, one of the smartest plays is to look towards Rainbow Fields, especially the Black Market area. This spot is highly contested in most games because of the valuable loot and mythics the Black Market provides. Chances are high that two or more teams will be there, either looting or actively fighting, which gives you a perfect opportunity to tag from a distance without committing to a full fight.
Your trio should take up a safe but elevated position nearby (on a hill or a rooftop just outside the zone of action) and look to third-party the fight. If you can beam a rotating player, get AR tags, or land some long-range shots, you'll rack up enough surge damage to keep you safe for the next zone without needing to overcommit.
Mid-Game Surge Example
If it’s mid-game and the zone pulls center, you might want to rotate slightly earlier and post up on a natural high ground between Seaport and Fields to catch teams late-rotating in.
If the lobby is really congested, don’t sit in Seaport too long — the farther you rotate late, the harder it is to find clean surge without getting focused.
Surge is all about being one step ahead and predicting where fights will break out. Use the knowledge of hot spots like the Black Market and smart timing to position your trio in places where surge comes to you — not the other way around.
Things to Note:
Storm surge is a leaderboard in each game with the team that has dealt the most damage being at the top of the threshold.
As you and other players do more damage your team moves up/down this leaderboard.
If you die all of the surge you have gotten doesn't count for your team even if you are rebooted your damage doesn't comeback.

- **Zone 1**
  - Complete your early game loot path
  - Farm your mats up especially metal at your dropspot
  - Predict when zone going to pull
  - Decide if you want to play deadside or not
  - WKEY if you have bad loot or if you beamed one of the player/players

- **Zone 2**
  - Decide if you want to play for kills or for placement 
  - If you want to play for kills rotate towards the center map but if you want to play for placement rotate deadside so that it’s harder for players to key you .

- **Zone 3**
  - Make sure you get 555 mats before zone 4
  - Get into a good position

- **Zone 4**
  - Don't sit still in a box, instead look through a cone so you can get intel on other players and plan your next rotate
  - Try and isolate yourself away from other players to avoid getting sprayed
  - Conserve your mats

- **Zone 5**
  - Find a good elevated spot from where you can see other players rotating.
  - Look for surge tags if you know surge is going to pop up.
  - Make sure you have cap mats and good heals going into endgame.
  - Look for 1v1’s if you have no surge, bad materials, bad loot or bad heals.

- **Zone 6**
  - First 50/50 zone
  - Take a gamble and position near center edge or play edge center
  - Try to be isolated away from other players so you don't get focused
  - Look for easy points on players rotating backside and get them lobbied

- **Zone 7**
  - Try to sit in a spot where you can rotate without being spotted my other players (nearby hills or next to houses )
  - Shoot other people that are the last to rotate as they are at the worst position.
  - Conserve your mats so that you have enough hard materials going into endgame.

- **Zone 8**
  -  Use a bit more mats to get in so your not with everyone on congested side of zone
  - Deadside is relatively free in moving zones
  -  You don't want to get caught back side in zone
  -  Focus on playing edge of storm 
  -  Make sure you're playing a good layer

  ## **Introduction:**
Deadside refers to the least congested area of the storm circle, typically opposite the bus path and away from major POIs. Rotating to deadside helps avoid unnecessary fights, allowing for safer positioning and better endgame survival.

## **Early Game:**
* Land at a POI that allows for an easy deadside rotation (e.g., edge POIs with good loot paths).
* Prioritize farming materials and getting mobility items early to enable smooth rotations.
* Scout the first zone and determine the best path to deadside based on enemy positioning.
## **Mid Game:**
* Begin rotating towards deadside once the first storm appears, avoiding major player clusters.
* Use natural cover like hills, trees, and buildings to stay hidden while rotating.
* Keep an eye on enemy movements and adjust your route accordingly.
## **Late Game:**
* Establish a strong position on deadside, ideally on high ground.
* Conserve materials by using deadside’s safety to minimize unnecessary builds.
* Monitor players rotating from the congested side and be prepared to capitalize on their weak positions.
## **Final Circles:**
* Stay patient and let other players fight in the congested areas before making a move.
* Time your rotation carefully, ensuring you are not caught in the middle of the zone pull.
* Move to a safer position when the zone is about to close, securing height or a good tarp.
* Only engage when necessary, such as when forced by Storm Surge or being pushed.
## **General Tips:**
* Always analyze the storm path and predict deadside before moving.
* Communicate with teammates (if in duos, trios, or squads) to coordinate safe rotations.
* Utilize natural terrain to stay hidden and reduce material usage.
* Plan ahead by marking potential deadside routes as soon as the first zone appears.

Understand Storm Circle Behavior
The first circle is random but generally stays within the starting safe zone.
Each new circle shrinks toward the center of the previous zone about 60-70% of the time.
The zone rarely pulls to the extreme edges multiple times in a row.

Pay Attention to Terrain
The game often avoids ending zones on high mountains, deep water, or extremely uneven terrain.
If there are large flat areas nearby, those are more likely to be final zones.

Center Zone Strategy
The center of the current safe zone has a higher chance of being in the next circle.
If you're playing for placement, positioning near the center (but not directly in it) can help.

Use Forecasting Items (If Available)
Some seasons have Augments or Forecast items that reveal future storm locations.
If these are in the game, prioritize them!

Observe Pro Players
Watch competitive players and tournaments to see common rotation paths and how they predict zones.

In solos you can save so many mats by re-using the old builds (peoples tarps) and then tarping off them when u get closer to zone.

You want to play a higher layer if you have mats so you don't get jumped on by the kids that are shambles.

look for refreshes when you have around 300 mats. Don't wait too long otherwise your chances of dying are much higher. - BUT! if you have 300 materials anytime after second moving zone, you don't need to force anything.

Try to play outer edges of zone when u are rotating. Getting stuck in the middle of zone means you have to cover both sides, but when playing edges zone you save materials since you won't need to block the storm line.

Don't greed any kills, just play for the win. Winning the game is better than just getting 4th with 2-3 more kills.

If you are need a refresh desperately, drop to lowground at around the 3rd moving zone. Try to get ahead and drop lowground.
